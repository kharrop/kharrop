## The best way to approach me with a problem

1. Who you are (if we haven't met), the team you're on, and the project
2. Context for the problem
3. What you've tried on your own
4. An idea of what you think will solve the problem

## The wrong college major

Out of college, I thought I had stumbled upon my dream job in the games industry. The problem was, my role at was pretty vague and I didn't really know what I wanted it to be. I felt like I was stuck in some kind of limbo of trying to find my "true calling" while figuring out what this job was.

I remember in one of my reviews with my manager, he asked:

> What do you really want to do?

I gave some lazy, mumbled reply of doing something in graphic design. But I didn't have a plan. Heck, I didn't even have a portfolio. I was too busy trying to prove I could do my current job to really commit to a different type of career.

## Wrong about design

- you don't know how to use dropshadows
- customization

## Wrong about code

- too much css, not understanding centering div
- not understanding classes vs ids
- tree shaking
