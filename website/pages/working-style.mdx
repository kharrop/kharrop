# Kelly's Working Style

A personal (ever-evolving) guide for how I work.

<div className="prose dark:prose-dark">

## People describe me as...

- **Resilient**: I am not afraid to fail and will try whatever it takes to solve problems
- **Empathetic**: I constantly consider how decisions impact others
- **Adaptive**: I approach problems with an open mind and can quickly pivot when needed

## My values

- **Being heard**: I really appreciate when my feedback is acknowledged (i.e., replying to a Google/Slack/Figma comment)
- **Sweating the details**: I strongly believe the details separate mediocre experiences from delightful ones
- **Collaborating**: I love when everyone on the team, regardless of discipline, is invested in solving problems together

## How I problem solve

1. **Talk to real people**: I first schedule time with people who could be having the same problem to understand their experience and see if they have suggestions for improvement
2. **Analyze the data**: Document my learnings and define common themes
3. **Experiment**: Throw together a quick low-fidelity prototype to test a few ideas
4. **Get buy-in**: Create a pitch that describes the customer problem, business impact, proposed timeline, success metrics, and attach the low fidelity concept to sell the vision
5. **Deliver**: Once I have buy-in, I can then work with the team to design and develop the end to end experience
6. **Learn**: Compare results against success metrics
7. Repeat

## A typical day

- I start the morning catching up on Slack messages, reading up on the latest design/tech news [on twitter](https://twitter.com/kellycodeschaos), and taking the time to document my mood and what my primary stress will probably be for the day.
- **Disclaimer**: I am **NOT** a morning person
- Because most of my coworkers are on the west coast, I **prioritize** tasks where I don't need to collaborate or ask questions (catching up on documentation, heads down code/design work, etc) before they wake up.
- Since our design system supports **multiple** business units and repos, it's helpful for me to knock out all the tasks for a given repo before moving to another one.
- I thrive when I can hop on a quick call with someone, do a bit of **pair programming/design**, establish a clear plan, and move forward.

## Personal growth

- Stay more focused when explaining something, instead of getting lost in the details
- Pause more when speaking to allow people to ask questions
- Being more explicit when it comes to asking for help on projects
