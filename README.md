### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UX Engineer currently leading the effort to create and integrate design tokens across the organization. I enjoy a healthy blend of systems and product design, while brainstorming on implementation approaches.

Most known for: `documentation`, `dev/design advocacy`, and `cringeworthy puns`
