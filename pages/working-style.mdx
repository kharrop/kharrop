# Kelly's Working Style

A personal guide for how I work.

<div className="prose lg:prose-xl">

## People describe me as...

- **Resilient**: I am not afraid to fail and will try whatever it takes to solve problems
- **Empathetic**: I constantly consider how decisions impact others
- **Adaptive**: I always have a Plan B (all the way to Z) and can pivot when needed

## My values

- **Being heard**: I really appreciate when my feedback is acknowledged (i.e., replying to a Google/Slack/Figma comment)
- **Sweating the details**: I get frustrated when details get overlooked and result in a less than stellar outcome
- **Collaborating**: I love when everyone on the team, regardless of discipline, is invested in solving problems together

## How I problem solve

1. Schedule time with people who could be having the same problem to understand their experience and see if they have suggestions for improvement
2. Document my learnings and define common themes
3. Throw together a quick low-fidelity prototype to test a few ideas
4. Create a strategy document that describes the customer problem, business impact, proposed timeline, and attach the low fidelity concept to sell the vision
5. Once I have buy-in, I can then work with the team to design and develop the end to end experience

## A typical day

- I start the morning catching up on Slack messages, reading up on the latest design/tech news [on twitter](https://twitter.com/kellycodeschaos), and taking the time to document my mood and what my primary stress will probably be for the day.
- **Disclaimer**: I am **NOT** a morning person
- Because most of my coworkers are on the west coast, I **prioritize** tasks where I don't need to collaborate or ask questions (catching up on documentation, heads down code/design work, etc) before they wake up.
- Since our design system supports **multiple** business units and repos, it's helpful for me to knock out all the tasks for a given repo before moving to another one.
- I thrive when I can hop on a quick call with someone, do a bit of **pair programming/design**, establish a clear plan, and move forward.

## Personal growth

- I'm trying to be more succinct since I tend to provide too many details up front, instead of letting people ask questions
- Being more explicit when it comes to asking for help on projects
