            Hello! ðŸ‘‹ <span className="spacer" />
            Iâ€™m a UX Engineer specialized in crafting large-scale design system
            solutions so teams can easily get what they need to deliver
            personalized experiences.

            I love helping engineers and designers speak the same language,
            while coaching teams to consider design-thinking principles and
            platform limitations.

              I've always wanted a space where I could implement a few
              experiments and learn from them. You can consider this site a
              constant work in progress.
